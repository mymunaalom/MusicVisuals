# Description of the assignment
For our group assignment we chose to do the music visualiser as a team. We chose the squidward tiki song from spongebob for a more light hearted visiualer and stuck to the theme of spongebob throughout the different images.

# Instructions

# How it works
We initially worked on a seperate file each, one visiualiser each and designed and coded that section on our own.
For my file I included different elements whilst in line with the theme. I included a background of a grid along with an imported picture of the spongebob beach background too to give it more emphasis. 
I created a outline of the screen to go in beat and pulse with the song with different altitudes and colour to give more dimention and a 'pop' to add something to the screen that will stand out and resemble to frequencies of the audio.
I also wanted to include a moving element onto the screen and tried to keep it with theme so I decided to make an ocean wave based on one frequency wave from the audio. I

This is code:

```Java
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```

So is this without specifying the language:

```
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```
